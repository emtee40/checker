How to build Metalink Checker

You will need the following:

Python 2.7.x - http://www.python.org
py2exe 0.6.9 - http://www.py2exe.org
pymetalink 6.1

The program can be run as a normal Python script if Python is present.  
Py2exe is not required, it is included only for 
supporting distribution to the masses without Python.

How to build a Java version

You will need the following:

Java SDK 1.6 - http://java.sun.com
Jython 2.5 - http://www.jython.org

Building on Windows
-------------------
buildapplet.bat - calls jython and the Java compiler to packages into a Java application, use the "opt" option for maximum compression
keygen.bat - generate a key to sign the Java applet, this is required to allow write access to the file system
py2exe.bat - calls py2exe to make executable files for windows and .zip package
setup.py merge - generates a single metalink.py script from the library
setup.py clean - cleans up the built files from your directory
nightly.bat - makes a datestamped build for all build types, calls py2exe.bat, setup.py merge, and sdist.bat
